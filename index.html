    <!--The Story of La La Mars-->
    <div class="marsContainer">
        <p class="marsButton">
            La La Mars, once home to the brilliant and elusive Nika alien species, is now a conquered land, ruled by the last Human King. When humans first set foot on Mars, they encountered Nika, the most genius creature of the planet, a being whose intellect far surpassed anything mankind had ever known. But in their thirst for power, the humans murdered Nika and claimed Mars as their own, renaming it La La Mars after their ruling dynasty. The ‚ÄúLa La‚Äù family name became synonymous with power and conquest, as the Human Kings extended their reign from Earth to Mars. Joyboy, the last Human King, now sits on the throne of La La Mars, wearing the infamous crown mask crafted from Nika's face, a grim reminder of the bloody origins of their rule. The colonization of Mars, though celebrated by humanity, remains shrouded in mystery, as few understand the full extent of what was lost with Nika's death. La La Mars, once a land of brilliance and innovation, is now under the shadow of human dominion, its original greatness forgotten. The Human King's rule, while mighty, is tied to the dark legacy of their conquest, a legacy that will one day see the downfall of their empire. For though humanity has taken Mars, the spirit of Nika lingers, waiting for the moment when the human race will face its final reckoning.
